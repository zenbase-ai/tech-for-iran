**We are builders.**

Many of us were born in Iran, or are children of those who fled. We've seen what Iranians create when barriers fall — in Silicon Valley, in Toronto, in London, in Berlin, in Tel Aviv.

Iran has 90 million people. A median age of 32. One of the highest rates of engineering graduates on Earth. A civilization that has been inventing things for three thousand years.

We believe a free Iran will be one of the great economic stories of our lifetime.

So we are making a promise:

When sanctions lift and Iranians are free to build, trade, and connect with the world — we will be ready. To invest. To hire. To partner. To build.
