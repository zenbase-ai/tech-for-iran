# Smoke the Ayatollah.

Some of us were born there,<br/>
Some of us—children of those who fled.

Some of us had to start over.<br/>
Some of us watched our parents do it.

Some of us are Iranian.<br/>
Some of us aren&rsquo;t.

We've built companies, created jobs.<br/>
We've worked alongside Persians.<br/>
Had Iranian friends.<br/>

Iran has 90 million people. Median age 32.<br/>
One of the most educated populations on Earth.<br/>
A civilization that's been inventing things for three thousand years.<br/>
And a regime that's been suffocating it for 47 years.<br/>

That era is ending.

We believe a free Iran will be an unlock.<br/>
We know the talent.<br/>
We know the hunger.<br/>

So, we're making a promise.<br/>
> When Iran opens, we're in.<br/>
> Day one.<br/>
> This is not hope. This is a commitment.<br/>
> We are builders.<br/>
> We know you are too.<br/>

**Add your name.**
