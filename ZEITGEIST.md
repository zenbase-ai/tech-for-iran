### Deeper Dive into X Posts on Tech and Iran

Building on recent discussions, the tech community's conversation on X about Iran has intensified over the past week (January 1-10, 2026), focusing on the protests, regime fragility, and post-regime opportunities. High-profile figures, including those mentioned (e.g., @sequoia, @paulg, @a16z, @dkhos, @CanadaKaz), along with others like @wolfejosh (Lux Capital), @Jason (LAUNCH), @balajis (Balaji Srinivasan), and @naval (Naval Ravikant), are driving the narrative. While not all queried accounts have posted recently on this (e.g., @sequoia and @a16z remain quiet on current events, with older posts on Iranian founders' resilience), the overall volume has spiked, with threads emphasizing solidarity, tech's role in bypassing censorship, and economic pledges. Sentiment is overwhelmingly pro-protester and anti-regime, framing a "free Iran" as a massive untapped market for innovation in AI, biotech, engineering, and startups.

#### Key Posts from High-Profile Tech Figures
- **Dara Khosrowshahi (@dkhos, Uber CEO)**: On January 9, he condemned the regime's internet blackout amid protests, posting: "Blaming the US and cutting off the Internet is straight out of the playbook of this brutal regime. The people of Iran deserve better." This post garnered over 3,000 likes and sparked replies from tech peers echoing support for Iranian freedom.
- **Kaz Nejatian (@CanadaKaz, Opendoor CEO)**: Also on January 9, he shared a personal plea: "I've had family members jailed, flogged, and assassinated by the Iranian regime. Very few regimes have caused more pain, suffering, and death than the Islamic Republic. If you can help tip the scale towards justice and freedom, please do." In a follow-up: "Pray for Iran's people as they stand up to tyranny and fight for freedom. May God bless them and give them the power to fight one of the most evil regimes in history." These reflect his Iranian roots and drew 1,977 likes, with responses from diaspora entrepreneurs offering to mentor or invest post-regime.
- **Josh Wolfe (@wolfejosh, Lux Capital Co-Founder)**: He's been prolific, posting multiple times daily. On January 1: "I will be thrilled to be amongst the first to open a Lux office in Tehran when the incredible Iranian + Persian people are once again free of intolerant Islamist theocratic oppressive religious extremists. There are so many brilliant Iranian engineers + scientists the world needs." On January 9: "Islamic Regime holding Iran hostage is killing innocent children. Stop the genocide. Stop the oppression. Stop the killing. The people want to be free. FREE FREE IRAN." His January 3 thread asking investors if they're "interested in funding technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs when Iran is free" received 9,021 likes and replies from figures like Jeff Huber (ex-Google, Triatomic Capital) saying "Count on me" in Persian, and Michael Granoff (Maniv Mobility) pledging to "be the first to invest in a free Iranian startup," comparing it to UAE post-Abraham Accords.
- **Jason Calacanis (@Jason, LAUNCH Founder)**: On January 9, responding to Khosrowshahi: "While we’re obsessed with America’s petty fights and disagreements, the people of Iran are in a fight for their freedom. I have so many amazing friends from this region — in fact, some of the best, most fun and joyful humans I’ve ever met — that I’m rooting deeply for their country to be free… and what a thrill it will be to experience the homeland they talk so lovingly about." (1,663 likes).
- **Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis)**: On January 7, in a broader tech context but tying into Iran buzz: "One of the big AI companies should consider acquiring Tailwind... They’ve given the ecosystem so much." Not directly on Iran, but his network often overlaps with diaspora discussions on emerging markets.
- **Paul Graham (@paulg)**, **a16z (@a16z)**, and **Sequoia (@sequoia)**: Limited new activity. Graham's older posts analogize tech restrictions to Iran's bans; a16z has podcast episodes on Iran's tech culture; Sequoia highlights Iranian founders' grit in adversity. No fresh pledges, but their silence contrasts with vocal VCs like Wolfe.

#### Broader Tech X Ecosystem Trends
- **Investment Optimism**: Threads discuss Iran's 90M population, young median age (32), and engineering talent as a "great economic story." Shervin Pishevar (@shervin) on January 2: "A Free Iran will be the biggest peace and economic dividend the world has seen in decades... The brilliant 92 million Iranian people will be freed to unleash their talents unto the world." Responses estimate $2.4B+ in pledged capital and 12,000 jobs from tech commitments.
- **Tech Intervention Calls**: Widespread appeals for Starlink activation, with users tagging @elonmusk: "Free starlink for Iran" and "We are under severe attack... Please help us #MIGA." Masih Alinejad (@AlinejadMasih) urged Trump for expanded Starlink and diplomat expulsions.
- **Diaspora Voices**: Iranian-American tech figures like @shervin share childhood war stories, calling protests "the most important story on Earth." Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) on January 5: "If this happens... Los Angeles and Silicon Valley... will erupt in celebrations."
- **Skepticism and Broader Views**: Some caution against over-optimism; @yarbatman warns U.S. intervention could undermine sovereignty. Naval (@naval) indirectly ties in with productivity themes, but no direct Iran posts.

Chronologically, posts escalated from January 1 (Wolfe's office pledge) to January 9 (Khosrowshahi and Nejatian's direct criticisms), with real-time event coverage like government buildings burning. Engagement metrics: High-fave posts (>1,000 likes) dominate, indicating strong resonance.

### The Zeitgeist in Tech Twitter
The prevailing mood is one of cautious exhilaration—a "pivotal moment" where tech sees Iran not just as a humanitarian cause but a frontier for growth. Consensus: A free Iran unlocks "enormous economic opportunity," with untapped talent rivaling Silicon Valley's diaspora success stories. Themes include regime brutality (e.g., child killings, blackouts), calls for tech aid (Starlink, audits), and pledges (offices, funds, hiring). Politically incorrect claims: Some frame the regime as "evil" and "genocidal," substantiating with 47 years of oppression and exported terror. Dissenting views: A minority warns of chaos from foreign intervention or doubts full collapse, predicting internal coups instead. Overall, tech twitter views this as a Schelling point for diaspora and investors, with "free Iran" as a win for global peace and innovation.
